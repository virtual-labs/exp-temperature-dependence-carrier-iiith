   - Temperature-independent carrier density
   - **Region Indicator**: Blue badge shows "EXTRINSIC"

3. **Intrinsic Region** (High Temperature: 300K-500K):
   - Intrinsic carrier generation dominates
   - Exponential increase with temperature
   - Slope proportional to band gap energy
   - **Region Indicator**: Red badge shows "INTRINSIC"
