      "question": "1. In a doped semiconductor, which of the following regions is observed at very low temperatures?",
      "answers": {
        "a": "Extrinsic region",
        "b": "Freeze-out region",
        "c": "Intrinsic region",
        "d": "Saturation region"
      },
      "explanations": {
        "a": "Incorrect. The extrinsic region dominates at moderate temperatures, not low temperatures.",
        "b": "Correct. At very low temperatures, most dopants are not ionized, resulting in the freeze-out region.",
        "c": "Incorrect. The intrinsic region dominates at high temperatures, not low ones.",
        "d": "Incorrect. There is no saturation region in the temperature-carrier concentration graph."

    {
      "question": "2. What happens to the intrinsic carrier concentration n_i when the temperature of a semiconductor increases?",
      "answers": {
        "a": "n_i decreases linearly",
        "b": "n_i remains constant",
        "c": "n_i increases exponentially",
        "d": "n_i oscillates periodically"
      },
      "explanations": {
        "a": "Incorrect. The relation is not linear; it is exponential.",
        "b": "Incorrect. n_i depends strongly on temperature.",
        "c": "Correct. Intrinsic carrier concentration varies as n_i ∝ exp(-E_g / 2kT), so increasing temperature leads to an exponential increase.",
        "d": "Incorrect. There is no oscillatory dependence."

        "b": "Electric field",
        "c": "Crystal orientation",
        "d": "Recombination lifetime"
      },
      "explanations": {
        "a": "Correct. At equilibrium, the Fermi level position depends on doping concentration and temperature.",
        "b": "Incorrect. Electric fields influence quasi-Fermi levels, not equilibrium Fermi level.",
        "c": "Incorrect. Crystal orientation affects mobility but not Fermi level location.",
        "d": "Incorrect. Recombination time does not determine Fermi level."

        "c": "Zero",
        "d": "Half the donor concentration"
      },
      "explanations": {
        "a": "Incorrect. In extrinsic regions, intrinsic carriers are negligible.",
        "b": "Correct. In an n-type semiconductor in the extrinsic region, nearly all donors are ionized, so n ≈ N_D.",
        "c": "Incorrect. Electron concentration cannot drop to zero in doped semiconductors.",
        "d": "Incorrect. Full donor ionization makes n ≈ N_D, not half."

      "question": "5. At high temperatures, the Fermi level in an n-type semiconductor tends to:",

        "d": "Stay fixed"
      },
      "explanations": {
        "a": "Incorrect. At moderate doping, the Fermi level starts near the conduction band but moves away as temperature rises.",
        "b": "Correct. At high temperatures, intrinsic carriers dominate, pushing the Fermi level toward the middle of the bandgap.",
        "c": "Incorrect. Fermi level does not shift below mid-gap unless it's a p-type material.",
        "d": "Incorrect. The Fermi level always shifts with temperature changes."

        "d": "np = n_i"
      },
      "explanations": {
        "a": "Correct. At thermal equilibrium, the mass-action law holds: np = n_i².",
        "b": "Incorrect. That’s an incorrect rearrangement.",
        "c": "Incorrect. n = p = n_i only in intrinsic semiconductors, not doped ones.",

        "c": "The valence band edge",
        "d": "The conduction band edge"
      },
      "explanations": {
        "a": "Incorrect. Mid-gap Fermi levels occur in intrinsic conditions, not freeze-out.",
        "b": "Correct. At very low temperatures, the Fermi level stays near donor states since most donors remain neutral.",
        "c": "Incorrect. Valence band edge is relevant for p-type at higher T, not freeze-out.",
        "d": "Incorrect. Fermi level shifts closer to conduction band only when donors are fully ionized."

      },
      "explanations": {
        "a": "Incorrect. At equilibrium, there is a single Fermi level.",
        "b": "Incorrect. Without bias, quasi-Fermi levels collapse into one.",
        "c": "Correct. Under non-equilibrium (bias or light), separate quasi-Fermi levels exist for electrons and holes.",
        "d": "Incorrect. Temperature stability does not affect the need for quasi-Fermi levels."

      },
      "explanations": {
        "a": "Incorrect. That describes the extrinsic region.",
        "b": "Correct. At high temperatures, intrinsic carriers dominate so n ≈ p ≈ n_i regardless of doping.",
        "c": "Incorrect. No permanent dominance of holes occurs; both equalize.",
